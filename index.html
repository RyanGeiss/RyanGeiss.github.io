            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p><strong>My name is Ryan. I am a student at Juniata College. I plan to graduate on May 2023 with a degree in computer science.<br>
                I've learned a great deal from Juniata and leanred from amazing professors. Eventually I plan to pursue a masters degree<br>
				in computer science when I become older and possible teach at a college some day. 
                </strong>Who are some of the best professors at Juniata?:
            </p>

            <h2>Favorite programming languages</h2>
            <p>So far, I'd say any C language is one of my favorites whether it be C++ or C#. There is much you can<br>
				program within those languages which is why I like them so much. Simple langauges like Python is fun to <br>
				tinker with but they have their downsides. One of my least favorite languages is Java; or machine code, programming <br>
				in that language is terrible.
                <strong>Here's a table of my most liked programming languages:</strong>
            </p>

            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th><u>Programming Languages</u></th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>C++</td>
                        <td>C#</td>
                        <td>Python</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
